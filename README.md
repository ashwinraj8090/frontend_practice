# Frontend Practice & Learning Archive (2024)

This repository serves as an index of my **frontend learning phase during 2024**.
During this period, I built multiple **UI-focused practice projects** using
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to understand core frontend concepts such as
layouts, forms, component structure, and basic application flows.

Each project was created as a **separate repository at the time** to preserve
commit history and reflect my learning timeline.  
All listed repositories are **archived**, as they represent foundational
practice rather than production-ready applications.

## Notes

- These projects are **frontend-only practice implementations**

---

## Future Direction

Some of these frontend projects may later be **unarchived or re-implemented**
with backend functionality (Flask / FastAPI / REST APIs) to become
**full-stack applications**, reflecting continued learning and growth.

*This index exists to provide clarity and context to my early frontend work
while keeping my GitHub profile clean and focused on current projects.*
